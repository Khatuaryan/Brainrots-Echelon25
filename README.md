# Self-Evolving Neuro-Symbolic AI for Fair & Future-Proof Hiring

**The Problem**

Modern AI-driven hiring systems often fall short - lacking adaptability, reinforcing biases, and operating as black-box models with little transparency. These limitations hinder career switchers, underrepresented candidates, and businesses striving for fair, data-driven recruitment.

**Common challenges include:**

* Outdated models that fail to keep pace with evolving job markets.
* Embedded biases that exclude non-traditional candidates.
* Opaque decision-making, leaving recruiters with little insight into AI-driven selections.

**The Challenge**

Develop an adaptive, bias-aware AI hiring system that:

* **Learns in real-time** - Continuously updates based on job trends, skill graphs, and industry reports.
* **Eliminates bias** - Embeds ethical constraints and fairness checks.
* **Provides explainable decisions** - Justifies recommendations with interpretable rules and skill-gap analysis.
* **Empowers recruiters** - Enables HR to refine AI decisions, adjust skill weightage, and track AI reasoning.

**What We Expect**

A functional, innovative, and scalable AI hiring solution that ensures fairness, real-time adaptability, and seamless human-AI collaboration - transforming recruitment for the future.
